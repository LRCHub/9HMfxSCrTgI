Wake up! Wake up! You've got to run away
Get up! Get up! Cause the troops are back again
Wake up! Wake up! Don't ever loose your faith
Get up! Get up! You've got to fight for some belief

Wake up! Wake up! Thousand miles to go
Get up! Get up! Will tomorrow ever show?
Wake up! Wake up! Go and grab your gun
Get up! Get up! Save you life
Cause the battle has begun

Well I'm Sergeant Smith and I'm six feet eight
I can kill a bull with just my weight
Give me a soldier I can train
And I'll bet the guy will learn the game

I'm Captain Timo Y.A.L.E. graduate
I can teach strategics and computer tricks
Give me a soldier to refine
And I'll bet the guy will be Einstein!

When the troops were proceeding
They were not aware of what was going on
Somehow the red glare in the horizon
Did not affect their thoughts
The eternal dirty rain washed their footsteps way
And the unreal sounds of machine guns
Bombs and screaming pain was their music
The music of 1997
